## About Folx

Folx is a comprehensive download management solution that combines the functionality of a traditional download accelerator with a fully-featured torrent client. It’s designed to give you complete control over your downloads, offering tools to manage, organize, and accelerate the process of retrieving files from the internet. Whether you're downloading large files from direct HTTP links or fetching content via BitTorrent, Folx provides a unified and powerful interface. Its integration with macOS, including seamless browser support, makes it feel like a natural extension of your system rather than a separate utility.

The application excels at optimizing the download experience. Its intelligent split technology can significantly reduce download times for directly linked files. For torrents, it offers detailed information about peers, seeds, and trackers. Folx also includes a powerful search feature to find torrents from major sites without leaving the app. Beyond speed, it focuses on organization—automatically sorting your downloads with tags and saving them to pre-set locations. This blend of acceleration, control, and automation makes Folx an essential tool for anyone who frequently downloads files and wants a more efficient and organized process.
